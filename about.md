description: I just love hotdogs and _I Think You Should Leave_
---

I am an a Senior Hotdog Analysis from Harvard, Boston. Here I got my Masters
PhD in Hotdog Analysis where I am legally able to discuss what is a hotdog and
what isn't a hotdog.

In this blog log, I am going to discuss the different types of hotdogs I have
eaten.

Besides my Masters PhD in Hotdog Analysis, I have qualifications on eating
hotdogs from a young age of baby. When my uncle would take care of me when my
parents were working, I would go to his refrigrator and take the pre-cooked
hotdogs out and slurp them hotdogs down like they were jello. Mhhhmm, wet cold
hotdogs, what great memories.

This did lead me to a hole of being a well rounded child, my nickname was "fat
kid" given to me by my parents and family.

I was able to get myself out of the hole, lost weight, and went to get my
Masters PhD in Hotdog Analysis at Harvard, Boston. I continue to eat hotdogs
today but as a luxury rather than for a past time.

I live by a quote that goes by
>The world always seems juicy when you’ve just made hotdogs that wasn’t there before. <cite>New Fork Times</cite>

As a hobby, I watch and quote _I Think You Should Leave_ by [Tim
Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfAf8oHrMo).
