**Catherine O'Brien** is an artist, engineer, and writer from Massachusetts. She is a senior at Barnard College studying Computer Science. She was named first runner-up for the Columbia Quarto Chapbook Competition in 2022 and has been published in Barnard *Echoes Magazine*. You can probably find her in a bookstore buying things she doesn't have time to read or at Coney Island swimming before it's seasonally appropriate.
