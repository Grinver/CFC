# Chasing Vincent

We moved to Sweden my 2nd grade for reasons I can only describe as a "simple twist of fate." We had watched a documentary about Scandinavia and my father happened to receive an offer to work there. That summer after 2nd grade, we had packed all our belongings in a few suitcases and migrated to the land of Vikings.

I had already bounced around a few schools before going to an international school where I was in a class full of every possible ethnicity I could really think of. This was the early start of long streak of feeling like I don't quite belong anywhere. Not truly Swedish. Didn't completely understand their customs. After school I would go to the local ice-skating rink and "practice" air hockey for hours. There wasn't really much to do and boredom is the precursor to discovery and perhaps a passion. Anyways, we went there so often that some hockey players recognized us playing hockey with broomsticks and mops. They gave us some old hockey sticks! It really made our day. Later, I would be able to meet Matts Sundin, a Swedish NFL hockey player who was retiring and had a hockey program. I learned to unicycle.


I moved to a new school again for 4th grade. It was a place called Runan.
I remember my friends Elias and Vladimir. You remember that feeling when you're starting college or highschool. That's how I felt whenever you start a new school. You don't know anyone. You don't speak their language well. You see when you're always the new kid, you're not exactly the most popular one in the room. 

Chasing Vincent. My very first day. This guy in my class named Vincent was picking on these girls. I was a pretty fast runner back then. So I started to chase him. Thinking I'd be the hero. He started running. We ran in circles trying to catch or tackle him. He slid down a muddy slope and got himself all muddy. An older kid congratulated me. That was one of my most embarassing memories to this date.

The playground at this school was literally a sloped small forest. Pinecones and apple trees. We'd play zombies vs. humans with the entire class since there was so many places to hide. Basically, there are a few zombies and the rest are humans. If the zombie tags you, you become a zombie. If by the end of the recess, everyone becomes a zombie, the zombie team wins. Otherwise, the humans win. It was actually excillarating to run through the icy cold forest with adreline like your life is on the line. I remember once the humans won solely because one of them was in the bathroom the entire time! Hilarious. I remember falling down, running away from a zombie, hurting my knee really bad. I still have that scar on my left knee.

Although, my parents began to sense a sense of isolation due to slight racial tensions and different cultures, I admittedly never felt truly alone. I had my sister and I had my family.
Here I built a homemade lab where I experiemented with basic circuits, toy remote control helicopters, 240V (didn't know better), sundials, lasers, rocks, explosives, chemicals, and practical jokes. I also made several homemade bows and arrows and slingshots I'd carry out to the local forest and try to shoot birds. I never hit one.
My father would teach us algebra, trigonometry and chinese chess. I can't say I had some profound love for it at this age. Perhaps with more exposure, that could have flourished. However, it gave me something to focus on for hours. I never felt alone because these things I could be trapped in my own thought bubble for hours at end. This may be some self-defense mechanism. (As you go to more and more urban places, parties are the complete opposite of this and come trigger a panic attack or a fight or flight reponse. I wasn't very fond of parties. I don't care what people think, it gives me anxiety. I just sometimes miss going to the forest, where the you can only hear your own breathe and the river of sounds from the forest, the rosy cheeks from the chill of the air. You pretend to be a hunter and trying to survive. )

My parents had gotten my sister, father, and me bikes. We rode to a nearby town Vista. Once, we rode back home through a forest in literal darkness. We didn't have a flashlight or phones. I know people from the city probably don't know how dark a forest can get at night. You only have the light of the moon to vaguely shine through the trees to vaguely make out the trail as you slowly ride. It was exhilarating to be at life's edge!
