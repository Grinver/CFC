# Chasing Vincent

We moved to Sweden for reasons I can only describe as a "simple twist of fate." We had watched a documentary about Scandinavia and my father happened to receive an offer to work there. That summer after my 2nd grade year, we had packed all our belongings in a few suitcases and migrated to the land of Vikings.

I had already bounced around a few schools before going to an international school where I was in a class of every ethnicity I could really think of. (Sweden took them as refuge) This was the early start of a lingering unsettling feeling. I wasn't truly Swedish. I didn't completely understand their customs or language.

Instead, after school I would go to the local ice-skating rink and "practice" air hockey for hours. Boredom is perhaps the precursor to passion. We went there so often that some hockey players recognized us playing hockey with broomsticks and mops. They gave us some old hockey sticks! It really made our day. In this same skating rink, I would be able to meet Matts Sundin, a Swedish NFL hockey player. 

At Sweden, I built a homemade lab where I experiemented with basic circuits, toy remote control helicopters, 240V of electricity (didn't know better), sundials, lasers, rocks, explosives, chemicals, and practical jokes. I also made several homemade bows and arrows and slingshots I'd carry out to the local forest and try to shoot birds - I never hit one.
It was here I'd learn to unicycle, ice-fish, and find myself lost in the world of my own mind.
My father would teach us algebra, trigonometry and chinese chess. 
I just miss going to the forest where the you can only hear your own breathe and the river of sounds from the forest.
You'd always come back with hot rosy cheeks.

My parents had gotten my sister, father, and me bikes. We rode to a nearby town Vista. Once, we rode back home through a 10 mile forest in literal darkness. We didn't have a flashlight or phones. You only have the light of the moon to vaguely shine through the trees to vaguely make out the trail as you slowly ride. It was exhilarating to be at life's edge.

For 4th grade, I moved to a new local elementary school called Runan.
It was closer within the city of Sollentuna.
I took on the well worn role of a new student again.
I remember my friends Elias and Vladimir.
Like always, I was the opposite of popular, instead only surrounding myself with few but trusted friends.

The play area at this school was literally a small sloped forest. We'd play zombies vs. humans with the entire class since there were so many places to hide. Basically, there are a few zombies and the rest are humans. If the zombie tags you, you become a zombie. If by the end of the recess, everyone becomes a zombie, the zombie team wins. Otherwise, the humans win. It was exhilarating to run through the icy cold forest with the adrenaline of animal being hunted down. One time, I fell down onto a rock and hurt my knee pretty bad. I still have that scar on my left knee.

On my very first day at this school, a guy named Vincent was picking on these girls at the muddy, foresty play area. Immediately, I felt he was an archetypal bully. (Really he was just teasing girls like all boys do) With a desire to impress these girls, the strange hero in me started to chase him. He started to run. Pretty soon we were a cat and mouse running over the sloppy hillside fields. We ran in circles while a group of classmates cheering me on. Ultimately, he slid down a muddy slope and got all his clothes covered in mud. In his public embarassment, all the classmates congratulated me. A few of the girls he was picking on even complemented me. In a hilariously embarassing way, I had defeated a school bully.
