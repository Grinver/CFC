# Blackout

My father grew up in the rural farmlands of the Anhui province in China.
There was a hot gusty sense of unburdened freedom when we visited our Nai Nai.
The unrestrained skies competing with the fenceless rice fields.
A smell of hot dirt roads and sweat stained shirts and cheap popscicles from the local city.
No electrical lights to bother us with unwelcomed news or unfamiliar faces to frighten us.

We visted our Nai Nai on our trip back from Sweden.
I was about 10 or so--as clueless as children come.
My sister and I would play with the chicken coops, watch our Nai Nai prepare a live chicken for dinner, throw dinner scraps under the table for the dog to eat, and fetch water from the well.
There's a comforting calm knowing that Mama, Baba, Nai Nai, and Ye Ye is all just a call away as you sit in the middle of the grassfields and listen to the crickets.

One day, Baba wanted to take the cargo tricycle bike out to journey into the village. It was a three-wheeled bike with one pedeler and a trunk in the back for me, my sister, and my mother. It all seemed like a great idea at the time. 

Of course, the bike was not designed for human passengers, much less three. Baba struggled to pedal on the uneven road. I saw his back sweat even to make even 20 feet. We asked if he needed help, but through his determined ego, he said he was fine and that they'd make it to the village. Then Nai Nai called out to us, yelling something none of us could quite make out. We all turned back to make out her fuzzy message.

At that moment, everything turned black. *Did I become blind?* Strangely, I didn't panic.
Warmness wrapped around me, but my vision had disappeared.
Through the anaphylactic shock, I heared my mom yell, "Get up! get up!"

I obeyed without question and stoodup, wiping a layer of black slime off my eye lids.
As my vision slowly focused, I realized that the entire tricycle had fallen into a sewer ditch.
Back in those areas, animal and human feces were tossed into ditches for runoff to take away.
Our entire family were completely covered in black goop.

I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. Nai Nai and our uncles had rushed over screaming.
"Are you okay?" They pulled us out of the ditch, one by one.
Soon, all the locals, including distant relatives came out to see the commotion.
(Or to see the fools who fell into the sewer ditch)

One of our distant uncles invited us to shower off in his home.
As we walked to his house, his wife shooed us away! (Ha! What comedic timing!)
Instead, we bathed off the goop in the local pond where all the catfish lived. 
Mama rubbed the corners of our ears and the hard to reach spots.

On our way home to Nai Nai's house, we were scolded relentlessly.
You really couldn't write an experience like that.
