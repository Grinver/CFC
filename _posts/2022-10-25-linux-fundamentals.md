- Bootloader - manages the boot process
- Kernel - the core of the system and lowest level of the operating system that manages the CPU, memory, and <div title = "an internal/external device that connects to a computer but isn't a core component, such as a keyboard, mouse, or speaker" style = "color:#6495ED;">peripheral devices</div>.
- Init System
- Daemons - background services (consider them servants) that run functions such as printing, scheduling, multimedia and sound during bootup or login. 
- Graphical Server

- Applications



#### Why Linux?
Linux is free, reliable, and open source. It's also more customizable and secure with strong support forums.

#### Linux Distributions
Linux distributions or distros are simply different versions that can be downloaded. The right one to use depends on personal preference and usage. Common distros include Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, Kali Linux, Arch Linux, etc.
